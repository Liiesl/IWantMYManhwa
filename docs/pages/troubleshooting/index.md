# Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions for the Manhwa Downloader extension.

## Extension Not Working

### "Site not supported" message
Make sure you're on a supported website. The extension works with:
- webtoonscan.com
- asuracomic.net

If you see this message on a supported site, try clicking **Re-check**.

### Nothing happens when clicking Scan
1. Wait for the page to fully load
2. Ensure you're on a series page (not a chapter page)
3. Check that the URL contains `/manhwa/` or `/series/`
4. Try refreshing the page

## Download Issues

### Downloads start but fail immediately
- Check your internet connection
- The site may be temporarily down
- Try again in a few minutes

### Some chapters fail to download
- Individual chapter failures are normal
- Failed chapters will be marked in the progress list
- You can retry specific chapters by selecting their range again

### ZIP file is empty or corrupted
- Ensure you have enough disk space
- Try downloading fewer chapters at once
- Check your browser's download settings

## Performance Issues

### Extension is slow
- Close unnecessary browser tabs
- Avoid downloading too many chapters at once (50+ at a time is recommended max)
- The site may be experiencing high traffic

### Browser becomes unresponsive
- This can happen during the final ZIP creation phase
- Wait for the process to complete
- For very large downloads, consider splitting into smaller batches

1. Check that you're using the latest version of the extension
